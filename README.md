A grid-based layout system for Flutter, optimized for user interface design.
Featuring:

* Fixed, flexible, and content-based row and column sizing
* Precise control over placement of items if desired, including the ability to
  span rows and columns, and overlap items
* A configurable automatic grid item placement algorithm, capable of sparse and
  dense packing across rows and columns
* Right-to-left support, driven by ambient `Directionality` or configuation

## Getting Started

All the terminology used in this library is shared with the CSS Grid Layout
spec. If you're unfamiliar, I recommend taking a look at [MDN's glossary of grid
terms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout#Glossary_entries).

For inclusion in your pubspec, see
[pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_layout_grid#-installing-tab-).

## Usage

```dart
const cellRed = Color(0xffc73232);
const cellMustard = Color(0xffd7aa22);
const cellGrey = Color(0xffcfd4e0);
const cellBlue = Color(0xff1553be);
const background = Color(0xff242830);

class Piet extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      width: 240,
      height: 200,
      color: background,
      child: LayoutGrid(
        columnGap: 12,
        rowGap: 12,
        templateColumnSizes: [
          FlexibleTrackSize(1),
          FlexibleTrackSize(3.5),
          FlexibleTrackSize(1.3),
          FlexibleTrackSize(1.3),
          FlexibleTrackSize(1.3),
        ],
        templateRowSizes: [
          FlexibleTrackSize(1),
          FlexibleTrackSize(0.3),
          FlexibleTrackSize(1.5),
          FlexibleTrackSize(1.2),
        ],
        children: [
          // Column 1
          GridPlacement(
            columnStart: 0,
            rowStart: 0,
            rowSpan: 2,
            child: _buildItemForColor(cellRed),
          ),
          GridPlacement(
            columnStart: 0,
            rowStart: 2,
            rowSpan: 2,
            child: _buildItemForColor(cellMustard),
          ),
          // Column 2
          GridPlacement(
            columnStart: 1,
            rowStart: 0,
            rowSpan: 4,
            child: _buildItemForColor(cellRed),
          ),
          // Column 3
          GridPlacement(
            columnStart: 2,
            columnSpan: 3,
            rowStart: 0,
            child: _buildItemForColor(cellBlue),
          ),
          GridPlacement(
            columnStart: 2,
            columnSpan: 3,
            rowStart: 1,
            rowSpan: 2,
            child: _buildItemForColor(cellMustard),
          ),
          GridPlacement(
            columnStart: 2,
            rowStart: 3,
            child: _buildItemForColor(cellGrey),
          ),
          // Column 4
          GridPlacement(
            columnStart: 3,
            rowStart: 3,
            child: _buildItemForColor(cellBlue),
          ),
          // Column 5
          GridPlacement(
            columnStart: 4,
            rowStart: 3,
            child: _buildItemForColor(cellMustard),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  Widget _buildItemForColor(Color c) =>
      DecoratedBox(decoration: BoxDecoration(color: c));
}
```

## Differences from CSS Grid Layout

Things in CSS Grid Layout that are not supported:

* Negative row/column starts/ends. In CSS, these values refer to positions
  relative to the end of a grid's axis.
* Any cells outside of the explicit grid â€” that is, if an item is placed outside
  of the area defined by your template rows/columns, we will throw an error.
  Support for automatic growth of the grid to accommodate out of bound items is
  certainly on the table, but I need some time to think about it (and write a
  better data structure for my placement grid).
* minmax(), percentages, aspect ratios track sizing
* No named areas, although they're coming

Differences:
* In `flutter_layout_grid`, flexible tracks do not account for their content's
  base sizes as they do in CSS. It's expensive to measure, and I felt this was
  an acceptable tradeoff.
* Flexible tracks whose flex factors sum to < 1

## Why not Slivers?
This library is not
[Sliver](https://medium.com/flutter/slivers-demystified-6ff68ab0296f)-based. I'd
considered it, but my use cases required the content-based sizing of rows and
columns, and I didn't want to figure out the UI challenges associated with
resizing. I might be interested in taking those on at some point.

## Roadmap

* [ ] Tests!
* [ ] Named template areas, for friendlier item placement
* [ ] Improved track sizing, including minimum/maximums and aspect ratios
* [ ] The ability to specify row and column gaps at specific line locations via
      a delegate
* [ ] Implicit grid support (automatic growth along an axis as children are
      added)
* [ ] Performance improvements, as soon as I can get this profiler
      running(!!!)
